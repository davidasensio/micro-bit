## Motivation

The BBC [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a pocket-sized computer that introduces you to how software and hardware work together.

Working with this microcontroller seems to me a fascinating way to learn some programming and electronics. I think it is the most brilliant tool since Arduino and it is way more simple. Microsoft i

In this hackweek I would like to try something new and learn about **Micro:bit** and implement a bunch of interesting [projects](https://microbit.org/projects/) that are available online for anyone to check it.

## Coding

Microsoft’s [MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/) is the perfect way to start programming and get creating with the BBC micro:bit. It can be programmed with **block** or **Python** text editors and also **Javascript**.

Just open your [browser](https://microbit.org/code/) and start coding.

Microsoft is the company supporting this tools and they are doing a really good job. By the way Microsoft has another tool [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) for coding games that if you are interested I think is really worth a try.
